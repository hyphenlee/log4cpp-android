log4cpp port for ios and android
* For iOS
Edit ios_build.sh to set platfrom at first.

 ./ios_build.sh

This will generate Xcode project file under ./build. Open
log4cpp.xcodeproj by Xcode and build it, then it would generate
liblog4cpp.a under build/bin . Change
ios_build.sh for different lib version, and use 

lipo -output libuniversal.a -create liba.a libb.b

to create a universal library for different platfrom.
* For Android
To build for Android you should edit android_build.sh to set arguments
like ndk path , api level at first.

./android_build.sh

Then the liblog4cpp.a would generate under build directory automatically.
